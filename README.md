EdX Software Development Fundamentals course

Course Overview:

This course, part of the CS Essentials for Software Development Professional Certificate program, will quickly cover Java syntax and keywords and then explore features of object-oriented programming including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You will learn how to apply these concepts to programmatic problem-solving by investigating class modeling techniques and relationships such as aggregation, realization, and generalization.

In addition to programming, you will learn about software testing techniques that help us find problems in our code, and you will use modern development environments and tools for tasks like debugging and unit testing. We will introduce Eclipse, the eclipse debugger and Junit (a unit testing framework).

After completing this course, you will be able to design, develop, and test large applications in Java and understand and apply core principles of professional software development.

Prerequisites:

            Basic knowledge of computer programming (variables, functions, control flow)

Course Outline:

        Week 1 - Java Basics: Variables, conditionals, and loops. Creating your first class in Java.
        Week 2 - Testing and debugging: Testing code while you write it in order to ensure that fewer bugs make it all the way to a client. Become an effective debugger by using tools that are within Eclipse. Learn how to handle things like bad inputs/wrong file formats, etc. 
        Week 3 - Intermediate Java: ArrayLists, encapsulation, static methods, and objects interacting with other objects.
        Week 4 - Polymorphism (one name, many forms): Using overloaded methods, class inheritance, and interfaces to ensure the least amount of code gets repeated. Polymorphism is generally considered one of the core principles of object oriented programming.
